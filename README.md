# Introduction
This project is both fascinating and challenging, where we will be working with threads and learn how to handle them effectively. The core idea of this project is to create a simulation with multiple philosophers of your choice. These philosophers will exist in a simulated world where they eat, sleep, and think. but here's the twist: they can only eat when they have two forks, and the simulation starts all at once, with all philosophers in motion. and here come our job to manage and organize the simulation to ensure that each philosopher can only eat when they have both forks.
# let's start with the beginning
  ## .what is a thread?
  When we run a program, a process takes charge, and this process may utilize multiple cores, depending on the device.Each core handles a single instruction of code at a time. In the context of threads, think of one thread an assignement given to a core. The core processes and executes multiple lines of code instructions associated with that thread.
 ## the problem we would be facing ?
   Since multiple cores can access the same memory, a problem can arise when one thread attempts to change the content of a variable in that process while another thread is doing the same simultaneously. This can cause the program to behave improperly.This is where the role of mutexes comes into hand. We got to use them correctly to prevent such conflicts; otherwise, they can work against us.
